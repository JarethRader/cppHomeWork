/*
A number of the form a + bi, in which i^2 = -1 and a and b are real numbers, 
is called a complex numbers. We call a the real part and b the imaginary part of a + bi.
Complex numbers can also be represented as ordered pairs (a, b).
Some mathematical operations on complex numbers are defined by the following rules:
(a, b) + (c, d) = (a+c, b+d)
(a, b) = (c, d) = (a-c, b-d)
(a, b) * (c, d) = (ac-bd, ad+bc)
As C++ doesn't have a built in type to manipulate complex numbers, let's define complex type 
using class to work with complex numbers.
By overloading operators +, *, >>, <<, etc., we can do aggregate operations on complex numbers
such as x + y and x*y where x and y are complex numbers.
